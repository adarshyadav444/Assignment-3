# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
# 2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
# 3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

#Using Recursion 
# def factorial(n):
#     if n <= 1:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return factorial(n-1) * n

# n = int(input("Please Enter Your Number: "))
# print(f"Factorial of {n} is: {factorial(n)}")
