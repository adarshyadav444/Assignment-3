Description:
In this program, factorial of a number is calculated using a function.

Explanation
#Using Recusrsion
- I've created a function named `factorial`
- If number is 1 or 0, function returns 1
- Otherwise function multiplies number with factorial of `n-1`
- Final factorial value is printed

   Problem 2: Math Module Program

Description
In this program, user enters a number  
The program calculates:
- Square root of the number
- Natural logarithm of the number
- Sine of the number (in radians)

Explanation
- First I imported the math module
- User enters a number
- I used `math.sqrt()` to find square root
- I used `math.log()` to find log value
- I used `math.sin()` to find sine value
- then all values are printed

this assignment helped me understand:
- Python functions
- Python math module
- Basic program structure
